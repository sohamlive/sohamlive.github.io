There are a few things in Thapar which are so good that you would want to sit back, relax and lavish praise on them. But it wouldn’t come through words; language would fail you. It wouldn’t come through actions either; you would be overwhelmed. How it happens is unique to everyone of us. The Fine Arts & Photographic Society (FAPS) is one such thing. Immensely talented and passionate people creating and exhibiting art in an all engineering college environment. Commendable efforts.

The society presented its annual exhibition Kaleidoscope 2017 on 15<sup>th</sup> November, 2017.  For one evening the otherwise drab SBOP Lawns transformed into a mesmerizing splendor of Art under a delightful canopy of lights. Around The World.
