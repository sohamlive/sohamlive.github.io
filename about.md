	<p class="intro">Hello internet stranger!</p>
	<p>Hi, I am SB! Born and brought up in Jamshedpur, Jharkhand. I am an Electrical Engineering graduate from Thapar Insitute of Engineering and Technology, Patiala and currently working in Oracle India. </p>
	<p> This is my personal blog. I prefer to call my posts random ramblings. Have a particular inclination towards railways, history, trivia, books and sometimes photography, the last still being in the nascent stage. Railways has always been a favourable means of transport - a childhood fixation carried on pleasurably till now. Hence, the name of this blog. Side Lower.</p>
