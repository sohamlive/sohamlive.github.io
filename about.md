	<p> I am Soham from Jamshedpur, my Jampot. This blog is my third effort at making my own space on the internet. This blog started in 2012 from Blogger, moved to Wordpress in late 2012 and now this place. I haven't moved any of my old posts prior to 2016 to this platform because some things are best left as it is, in the past. A curious might perhaps dig deep through the internet to find my old blog but this action is not recommended by me. </p>

	<p> An engineer by education, I was working in tech till May '23 and currently following the Indian Engineer roadmap of doing an MBA. I am currently a student at XLRI Jamshedpur. I can be found mostly reading up about railways, history, cities, general fiction or just travelling on trains which has been my fixation from a young age. Hence, the name of this blog. Interested in quizzing, writing letters, and sending postcards (<a href="https://www.postcrossing.com/" target="_blank">Postcrossing</a>). I also go by the name <em>Jampotwala</em> on <abbr title="Twitter, Instagram">some</abbr> platforms. </p> -->

	<p> I spent my growing years in Jamshedpur then went to Patiala, Punjab for my engineering degree. It was an experience like none other - forged new friendships, celebrated, embraced losses, quizzed, blogged and finally at the end of 4 years (which was cut short by the Pandemic of 2020), found myself working in tech. Here, I stayed for close to 3 years. The latter days were mostly spent on preparing for MBA exams alongside my job and in 2023, landed back in Jamshedpur. This time at XLRI Jamshedpur where I currently am pursuing my PGDM in Business Management.</p>
