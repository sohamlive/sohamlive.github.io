I"<p>There are a few things in Thapar which are so good that you would want to sit back, relax and lavish praise on them. But it wouldn’t come through words; language would fail you. It wouldn’t come through actions either; you would be overwhelmed. How it happens is unique to everyone of us. The Fine Arts &amp; Photographic Society (FAPS) is one such thing. Immensely talented and passionate people creating and exhibiting art in an all engineering college environment. Commendable efforts.</p>

<p>The society presented its annual exhibition Kaleidoscope 2017 on 15<sup>th</sup> November, 2017.  For one evening the otherwise drab SBOP Lawns transformed into a mesmerizing splendor of Art under a delightful canopy of lights. Around The World.</p>
