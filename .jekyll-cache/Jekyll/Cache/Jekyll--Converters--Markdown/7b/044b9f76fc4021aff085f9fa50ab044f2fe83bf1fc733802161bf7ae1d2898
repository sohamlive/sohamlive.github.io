I"ó<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">M</span>y last post was some 8 months ago and to be frank I have grown to be much lazy to update my blog regularly as I used to do earlier. The reasons are myriad and stupid (and also treacherous) not worthy enough but still I will write it here so that they can serve as a precursor to the coming babble.</p>

<p><em>Didnâ€™t read any books any books in these 8 months.</em> <br />
<em>Away from Home. The missing of homemade food threw my creative senses to a haywire.</em> <br />
<em>Procrastination. â€˜Ok tomorrowâ€™ gave way to the day after tomorrow.</em> <br />
<em>Thought maintaining a blog is a useless hobby. Who reads what I write? Who cares?</em> <br />
<em>Suffered a writerâ€™s block. Couldnâ€™t think of anything. Couldnâ€™t get inspiration.</em> <br />
<em>Moved a lot. Crisscrossed half of India along its length. Took a lot of time of adjust.</em> <br />
<em>Listening to a lot of good songs. Got my myself lost in the trance of their lyrics.</em> <br />
<em>Removing the dust off another hobby, my other love â€“ Quizzing. I have been away a lot from this person that my memory of it became cloudy.</em></p>

<p>So that was it.</p>

<p>I moved to Bangalore in the end of July. And again moved to Patiala in mid-August to Thapar University. I got into Electrical Engineering and am pretty much happy about it. Although it was not a smooth transition something not to write about here.</p>

<p>A new city and a new college brought with self new problems, new experiences and most importantly a new language â€“ Punjabi. It took some time to adjust to learn that <em>Haanji</em> means Haan i.e yes, <em>Kithe</em> means Kidhar i.e where and the epic â€“ <em>Aur veere kidda?</em> Which translates to And brother whatâ€™s up?</p>

<p>Phew! That was a challenge. But one of the most difficult phases was getting to know people. I joined a little late and that my dear reader is pretty crappy experience at least for someone who is an introvert like me. Thankfully that was taken care of soon enough.</p>

<p>But then another problem presented itself. Being a Bengali who grew up eating non-veg (aka fish) every alternate day the rajma-chawal and makke ki rotti with sarson ka saag was a nightmare. Whereâ€™s the fish? My stomach and my heart used to (still) scream every night at the mess. Sadly, this is a predicament of which I have still not been able to find an answer. Till then have to survive somehow.</p>

<p>The Punjabiness of Thapar led my heart to yearn for something more, something which I didnâ€™t knew about until LitSoc â€“ The Literary Society of Thapar presented its intra year fest â€“ Elixir. The meeting of like minded people, getting to know others was a beautiful experience. But thereâ€™s another thing LitSoc gave me â€“ TQC Thapar Quizzing Club. Now this is family. A lifelong desire fulfilled. In between the pounce and the bounce and the scraps I realized that this is it. This is home. Sorry to be so melodramatic but I couldnâ€™t express myself in a better way.</p>

<p>Mid-Semester Examinations â€“ letâ€™s skip that.</p>

<p>End-Semester Examinations â€“ Letâ€™s skip that too.</p>

<p>I promise that I will I write something better on these when thereâ€™s a better time.</p>

<p>Till then I wish you a happy new year 2017.</p>
