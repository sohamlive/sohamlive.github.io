I"ê<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>his is a late, late 2018 hangover post. I should have been done with it earlier but procrastination got the better of me. I have never been much of music connoisseur. Ever since my schooldays, I have been suggested songs to listen and shared with. That practice hasnâ€™t changed much. People still suggest songs to me and this activity has led to the development of some really cherished friendships. My Aekla Cholo Re credo doesnâ€™t hold much ground here. Whenever people suggest me or share with me songs, I associate a distinct memory of mine with the song. So, whenever I listen to it again, the song reminds me of those memories. And such memories lead the way to more posts such as this.</p>
