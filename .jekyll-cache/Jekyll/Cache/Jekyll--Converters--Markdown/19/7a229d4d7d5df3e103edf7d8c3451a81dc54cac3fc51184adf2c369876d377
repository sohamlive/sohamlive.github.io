I"ü<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n school, we had a topic on letter writing. I always chose formal letters. They were short, scoring. I donâ€™t think I have ever written an informal letter unless compelled to. The prospect of writing to a friend or family and getting it corrected marked by a third person didnâ€™t find any favour in me. These are supposed to be personal, with emotive warmth, soothing. I did not want to get marks by laying bare my personal thoughts to some other person.</p>
