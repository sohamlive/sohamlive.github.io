I"ß	<p>Took these over the past month or so.</p>

<p>Quintessentially random images taken from a boring perspective, having no subjects, theme or quality. Mediocrity at its best.</p>

<p>Also features a self portrait after realizing that the last one was removed a few years ago.</p>

<p>Hostel J â€“ A time when Thapar still took care, quality, aesthetics and functionality in focus while building its hostels.</p>

<p>When this photo was taken, these flowering plants were still present on the divider en route to COS. A few days ago all these were trimmed. The divider is now just a bare collection of concrete tiles. The monotony of the pathway is broken by the empty soil mounds where only the twigs remains. No greens. No flowers any more. An eyesore.</p>

<p>Early to bed, early to rise will reward you with a view so nice. This is the first morning after the torrential rains which hit Northern India in September subsided.</p>

<p>The early morning chill has begun to set in. It is misty outside and the birds are yet to wake up. The hostel is still sleeping â€“ it is 6 in the morning. Everything is so quiet and serene around.</p>

	<figcaption>Symmetry Fail Walkway</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Just after 1 PM or perhaps just before on a warm October afternoon. Thought that with the less crowd flow, I could finally take a photo of this walkway connecting E to F and D blocks, incorporating symmetry and restarting my dormant Instagram with something different. The black and white is a tribute to my bravado on getting inspired by Raghu Rai. Sigh!</p>

	<figcaption>Quiz â€“ A Modern Art</figcaption>

<p>15 people. One question. Hands on chin. Sombre expressions. Sometimes I am amazed at how one question can bring forth a myriad amount of expressions from people. Clueless, Pride, Dejection, Anger, Stupidity â€“ this.is.quiz.</p>
